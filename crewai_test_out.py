A book exploring the future of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through the central metaphor of aviation history.
The core thesis is that the current approach to AGI, which focuses on mimicking human thought, is a modern-day "ornithopter"‚Äîa machine that perfectly imitates a bird but will never achieve true flight.
The book argues that true AGI will only be achieved by discovering the first principles of emergent intelligence.
The book should be structured in three parts.
Part 1, "The Seduction of the Ornithopter," will deconstruct the current AI paradigm.
Part 2, "The Principles of Flight," will define the alternative path forward.
Part 3, "The First True Airplane," will be a forward-looking exploration of what a true, non-human AGI could do.
