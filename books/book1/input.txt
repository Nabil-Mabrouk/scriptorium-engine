  "raw_blueprint": "A book exploring the future of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through the central metaphor of aviation history. The core thesis is that the current approach to AGI, which focuses on mimicking human thought and conversation (like Large Language Models), is a modern-day \"ornithopter\"â€”a machine that perfectly imitates a bird's flapping wings but will never achieve true flight. The book argues that just as aviation required discovering the first principles of aerodynamics (lift, thrust, drag), true AGI will only be achieved by moving beyond human mimicry to discover and engineer the fundamental principles of emergent intelligence. The book should be structured in three parts. The first part, \"The Seduction of the Ornithopter,\" will deconstruct the current AI paradigm, celebrating its successes while revealing its limitations. The second part, \"The Principles of Flight,\" will define the alternative path forward, focusing on concepts like multi-agent systems and emergent complexity. The final part, \"The First True Airplane,\" will be a forward-looking exploration of what a true, non-human AGI could do for science, technology, and humanity."
